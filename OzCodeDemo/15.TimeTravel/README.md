# Time Travel

**In regular debugging, once a breakpoint hits, we are able to see the state of the program as it is now. We can evaluate any expression and get its value as it is when the program hits our breakpoint. Time Travel Debugging in OzCode changes the game and allows you to Predict the Future.
While standing on any breakpoint, OzCode will run through the rest of the method and evaluate all the lines of code in the future. You will be able to see the result of the prediction with a Heads-up-display (HUD).**
